- 👋 Hi, I’m @ari099
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create some great GUIs for desktop using the web languages I know (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything involving front-end or back-end web. If there's anything in Python I could assist with, I would be more than happy to!
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at ariellorenzo08@gmail.com. Let me know who you are and how I can lend my services! I look forward to hearing back!
